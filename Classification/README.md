# Machine-Learning-Hackathon-1-Classification

Hackathon was conducted on Kaggle.

**Description**: You are given a bunch of metrics for car owners. Your job is to predict whether a particular car owner will have a car accident in this year.

**Evaluation**: Evaluation will be using the ROC-AUC score on the target. Wherever possible, use predict_proba or use the predict_proba of a CalibratedClassifierCV -- ROC-AUC score metric expects a probability for the y, not a 0-1 label for y.

**Rules**: Mentioned in the pdf.
